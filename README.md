# Project 2: RNAseq

Please refer to the [instructions](https://bu-bioinfo.github.io/bf528/projects/project_2_rnaseq/)
on the website for how to complete project 2. 

# Reminders
- The week divisions in the directions are just suggestions for a reasonable amount of progress. The
final report will be due on the listed date in the schedule.

- I will make sample results available partway through the project to ensure that everyone can proceed to the biological analysis at some point. I will also reveal the original publication around
this time so that you may compare your findings 

- Only switch to the full data when you are 100% sure your pipeline works end-to-end. Please also
make sure that you only run your pipeline once on the full data and to delete any old runs if you do
happen to run it multiple times.

- Be mindful of time and make sure that you don't fall too behind. Please reach out to the TAs or myself if you do find yourself struggling and unable to advance.
